# Overview

This is the official documentation for Todoist REST API. Our original API,
named [Sync API](/sync/), provides an easy way to deal with full and partial
syncs, but it's not so simple for individual calls. REST API aims to provide API
developers a friendly way to deal with the most basic features of Todoist API.

### Request and response format

API endpoints accept arguments either as url-encoded values for non-POST
requests or as json-encoded objects encoded in POST request body with
application/json Content-Type.

Each modification request may provide additional `X-Request-Id` HTTP header that
could be used as an unique string to ensure modifications are applied only once
â€” request having the same id as previously seen would be discarded.

It's is not required but can be handy if you need to implement any request
re-trying logic. This header value should not exceed 36 bytes. We will be
generating them with `uuidgen` for shell and `uuid.uuid4` for Python in the code
examples.

This API relies on standard HTTP response codes to indicate operation
result. The table below is a simple reference about the most used status codes:

Status code | Description
------------|------------
200 | The request was processed successfully.
204 | The request was processed successfully without any data to return.
4xx | The request was processed with an error and should not be retried unmodified as they won't be processed any different by an API.
5xx | The request failed due to a server error, it's safe to retry later.

All `200 OK` responses have the `Content-type: application/json` and contain a
JSON-encoded representation of one or more objects.

Payload of POST requests has to be JSON-encoded and accompanied with
`application/json` Content-Type header.
